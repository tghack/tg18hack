# misc - The netcat-1
**Points: 25**
```console
DESCRIPTION
     The nc (or netcat) utility is used for just about anything under the sun
     involving TCP or UDP.  It can open TCP connections, send UDP packets,
     listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports, do port scanning, and deal with
     both IPv4 and IPv6.  Unlike telnet(1), nc scripts nicely, and separates
     error messages onto standard error instead of sending them to standard
     output, as telnet(1) does with some.
```

``` bash
> nc nc1.tghack.no 7878
```
